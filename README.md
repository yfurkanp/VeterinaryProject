    VETERINARY PROJECT
-I create simple veterinary application with spring+thymeleaf.
-I create two entity class.(Animal and Owner).This relation with OneToMany.One owner has more than one pet.
-Each of these classes has a controller.
-I have associated model and view in controller classes with thymeleaf.
-These controller classes have listing, adding, updating and deleting methods.
-I used postgres as database. Because I will deploy my project on heroku. I chose postgres because postgres is free in heroku.
-This database has two table for project.(owner and animal table).
-I create two repository and these repositories.
-These repositories allowed me to relate Jpa to database.
-I created 4 view classes for the view layer and made a simple design for the frontend.
